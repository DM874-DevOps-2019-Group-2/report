% The structure below is a guideline for the project description. The main sections are given in the following list. Feel free to insert subsections as you see fit.

% 1 - Introduction. This section gives an overview of the motivations and results of what you have done. Describe the challenge that you want to address, motivating why it is relevant.

% 2 - Preliminaries. Give a brief overview of the background knowledge needed to understand your report. Provide references to what you have used and report the main concepts that your work is based on.

% 3 - Technical Description. Here you explain the technical work you have carried out. You may include code snippets where relevant, and refer to source code in the project files. Try to explain the development choices you did taking into account important properties such as deployability, availability, reusability, security, modifiability, performance.

% 4 - Related Work and Discussion. In this section you review the relevant state of the art. This may include alternative solutions to the same challenge you have tried to address in your project, or alternative methodologies that you may have followed (e.g., choice of other technologies for implementing the project). Provide a discussion on the implications of your choices in the design of your work and the technologies/techniques that you have used.

%     References (or Bibliography) This section should contain references to the articles/websites/resources/etc. cited in your report.
