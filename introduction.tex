The purpose of this project has been to develop a chat application that allows its users to automate in- and outbound messages,  through user uploaded scripts written in the service oriented programming language, Jolie, while maintaining security.

The underlying infrastructure of the application itself has been built as a micro-service architecture with the goal of affording developers greater atonomy and agility in the limited scope that they are responsible for.

The choice of a micro-service architecture also helps another key goal, namely that of good horizontal scalability; we have utilized the venerable container orchestration framework, Kubernetes to facilitate this. Every service is containerized using Docker, and managed as pods in Kubernetes.
